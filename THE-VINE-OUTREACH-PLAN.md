# 🌿 THE VINE — 20-Point Community Outreach Plan
## Athens, Tennessee | McMinn County | Ocoee River Region

---

> *"I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit."* — John 15:5

---

## GUIDING PHILOSOPHY

This is not a church growth strategy. This is a **people strategy**.

The Vine doesn't exist to fill a building. It exists to fill a void — the void that people feel when every church they've walked into has made them feel like an outsider. This outreach plan is built on three convictions:

1. **Go to them.** Don't wait for people to come to us. Show up where they already are.
2. **Serve first, talk later.** Earn the right to be heard by being useful, present, and genuine.
3. **Build bridges, not booths.** We're not handing out flyers. We're building relationships that outlast any single event.

Every initiative below is designed to connect with real people in the Athens/McMinn County area — particularly those the traditional church has historically overlooked: the IT crowd, gamers, bikers, the tattooed and pierced, creatives, skeptics, and anyone who's been told they don't belong.

## SECTION 1: THE 20-POINT OUTREACH PLAN

---

### POINT 1 — "TERMINAL": Weekly Code & Coffee at Blue Front Coffee Co.
**Type:** Recurring gathering | **Frequency:** Every Wednesday, 8:00–10:00 AM
**Location:** Blue Front Coffee Co., 5 W College St, Athens

**What it is:** A weekly open hangout for developers, sysadmins, IT professionals, help desk workers, cybersecurity people, students, and anyone who's curious about tech. Bring your laptop, grab coffee, and work alongside other local techies. No agenda. No pitch. Just community.

**Why it matters:** Athens has a handful of IT service companies (Information Solutions IT, Mtech, CompNet, The Computer Works), DENSO employs tech-adjacent workers, TCAT Athens trains IT students, and a growing remote-worker population works from home with zero local community. There is *no* dedicated tech meetup in Athens — the nearest is Chattanooga Tech Council, an hour away. This fills a real gap.

**Tactics:**
- Partner with Blue Front Coffee Co. for a standing reserved area (buy coffee, not rent space)
- Create a Discord channel (`#terminal`) for async conversation and session announcements
- Post in the Voices of Athens Facebook group and on Meetup.com
- Leave a standing invitation at The LITE House coworking space (yourlitehouse.com)
- Reach out to TCAT Athens IT program and Tennessee Wesleyan CS students
- Print subtle table cards: `> the vine // terminal — code & coffee — wednesdays 8am — all levels welcome`
- Keep it *aggressively* non-churchy. This is a tech hangout that happens to be hosted by church people. Faith conversations happen organically or not at all.

**Success metric:** 5+ regular attendees within 3 months who would describe it as "my Wednesday thing."

---

### POINT 2 — "RESPAWN": Monthly Game Nights (Open to the Public)
**Type:** Monthly event | **Frequency:** First Friday of every month, 6:00–10:00 PM
**Location:** SE TN Trade & Conference Center (Athens Regional Park) or rented community room

**What it is:** A wide-open game night. Console gaming stations (Switch, PS5, retro emulators), tabletop RPG one-shots (D&D, Pathfinder, Blades in the Dark), board games (Catan, Betrayal, Gloomhaven, Codenames), card games (MTG casual play, Pokémon), and LAN party setups when feasible. Free entry. Free snacks. All ages.

**Why it matters:** Athens already has an active D&D community — the E.G. Fisher Public Library runs Tabletop Guild sessions Monday/Tuesday/Thursday evenings with multiple DMs (Scott, Alex, Chase). There's a Facebook group for Athens TN Trading Card Games. Pair A Dice Games on Washington Ave recently closed, leaving a hole. Dicehead Games in Cleveland is 20 minutes away. There is demand and shrinking supply for local gaming community space.

**Tactics:**
- Coordinate (not compete) with the Library's Tabletop Guild — invite their DMs to run one-shot sessions at Respawn; promote their ongoing campaigns
- Reach out to the Athens TN Trading Card Game Community Facebook group
- Contact former Pair A Dice Games customers/community (their Facebook page is still up)
- Set up 4 zones: Console Corner, Tabletop Territory, Board Game Bar, Card Arena
- Provide a "New to Tabletop?" intro table where someone teaches a beginner-friendly game every session
- Create a Discord channel (`#respawn`) with LFG (looking for group) threads
- Advertise through TCAT Athens, TWU student activities board, and local high schools
- Consider quarterly "tournament nights" with themed prizes (retro game tournaments, Magic drafts)

**Success metric:** 20+ people per night within 6 months, with at least half being non-church-connected.

---

### POINT 3 — "IRON HORSE": Monthly Motorcycle Fellowship Rides
**Type:** Monthly ride | **Frequency:** Second Saturday of every month, 9:00 AM departure
**Location:** Meet at a public lot in Athens; ride through Ocoee/Hiwassee river corridors

**What it is:** A non-club-affiliated group ride open to all bikes, all brands, all experience levels. No patches, no politics, no hierarchy. Just riders who want to enjoy the Ocoee and Hiwassee river roads together, stop for lunch at a small-town spot, and build friendships on the road.

**Why it matters:** Southeast Tennessee is motorcycle paradise — US-64 along the Ocoee, Cherokee National Forest backroads, the Cherohala Skyway within reach. The area already has active MC presence: Roughnecks MC (Bradley-Meigs chapter), Widowmakers MC (Athens), Rebellious Few MC (Cleveland), and the new MFC Whitewater Chapter. But many riders aren't "club guys" — they ride solo or with one buddy. Iron Horse is for *everyone* who rides, club-affiliated or not.

**Tactics:**
- Establish Iron Horse as intentionally non-club: no patches, no prospects, no dues. Just show up and ride
- Plan 12 distinct routes rotating through: Ocoee Scenic Byway, Hiwassee River Road, Cherohala Skyway, Tellico Plains loop, Reliance/Hiwassee put-in loop, Copperhill/Ducktown circuit, Etowah railroad loop, Benton Falls route, and seasonal mountain runs
- Post ride routes and meetup details on the Scenic City Motorcycle Enthusiasts Facebook group and local rider forums
- Reach out respectfully to Roughnecks MC Bradley-Meigs chapter — they do charity rides and Bike Nights (2nd Thursday at Applebee's in Cleveland). Attend their events as guests. Build mutual respect.
- End each ride at a local restaurant for lunch — rotate through small-town spots (Reliance Fly & Tackle, Calhoun's, Etowah diners)
- Vine members who ride wear simple, friendly identification — a small vine emblem pin or sticker, not a back patch
- Create a `#iron-horse` Discord channel for ride planning and weather calls

**Success metric:** 8–15 riders per month by month 6, representing a mix of church and non-church riders.

---

### POINT 4 — "BRANCHES": Discipleship Micro-Groups
**Type:** Ongoing relational discipleship | **Frequency:** Weekly (day/time set by each group)
**Location:** Homes, coffee shops, restaurants — wherever the group decides

**What it is:** The core engine of The Vine. Groups of 3–5 people (same gender) who commit to meeting weekly for honest conversation, Scripture study, prayer, and mutual accountability. Not a Bible study class. Not a lecture. A relationship where you can say "I'm struggling" and know you'll be met with grace, not judgment.

**Tactics:**
- Vine leadership personally invites people into Branches — this isn't a sign-up sheet, it's a relational ask
- Each Branch has a simple rhythm: Check-in (how are you *really* doing?), Scripture (what's God saying to you this week?), Prayer (what do you need?)
- Leaders model vulnerability first — share their own struggles before asking others to
- Branches are the primary vehicle for identifying and developing individual gifts and callings (per The Vine's mission)
- Every Branch member is asked: "What do you think God made you for?" and the group actively helps them pursue that answer
- Branches can form around affinity: a "coder's branch," a "biker's branch," a "dad's branch" — as long as the relational depth is maintained
- Training: provide a simple one-page guide for Branch leaders (not a curriculum — a framework)

**Success metric:** Every regular Vine attendee is in a Branch within their first 6 months. 80%+ retention quarter over quarter.

---

### POINT 5 — Partnership with Love Thy Neighbor Project (TWU)
**Type:** Ongoing service partnership | **Frequency:** Monthly volunteer commitment
**Location:** Love Thy Neighbor Project, 204 E College St, Athens (TWU campus)

**What it is:** The Love Thy Neighbor Project is Tennessee Wesleyan University's food insecurity initiative. They run the TWU Food Bank, the Back Sacks Program (weekend meals for ~70 schoolchildren), and Mobile Food Pantries serving 1,400+ households annually in food deserts across McMinn County. They need volunteers for sorting, packing, distribution, and mobile pantry staffing.

**Tactics:**
- Commit a Vine volunteer team of 4–6 people to one mobile food pantry distribution per month
- This is *service*, not *branding*. No Vine T-shirts. No flyers. Just show up, do the work, love people
- Vine members serve under LTNP's leadership — we are their volunteers, not the other way around
- Contact: (423) 746-5215 or lovethyneighbor@tnwesleyan.edu
- Build relationship with TWU's Center for Service and Leadership; participate in their annual Day of Service (fall)
- Over time, explore sponsoring a monthly Back Sacks packing day as a Vine community event (families welcome)

**Success metric:** Consistent monthly presence for 12+ months. LTNP staff knows our people by name, not by church name.

---

### POINT 6 — "BASECAMP": Monthly Outdoor Adventures
**Type:** Monthly outing | **Frequency:** Third Saturday of every month
**Location:** Rotating — Ocoee River, Cherokee National Forest, Chilhowee, Hiwassee, local parks

**What it is:** Outdoor recreation for all fitness levels. Kayaking the Ocoee, hiking to Benton Falls, mountain biking at Chilhowee, fishing at Parksville Lake, rock climbing at Foster Falls, camping weekends in Cherokee National Forest. This is church in God's creation, surrounded by the most beautiful landscape in Tennessee.

**Tactics:**
- Plan a 12-month adventure calendar with difficulty ratings (Easy / Moderate / Send It)
- Always include a "chill option" — not everyone wants to paddle Class III rapids. Some people want to sit by the river and read.
- January: Winter hike (Benton Falls — easy, 3 miles), February: Indoor climbing gym trip (Chattanooga), March: Spring equinox sunrise hike (Starr Mountain), April: Hiwassee River float (easy paddle), May: Chilhowee mountain bike day, June: Ocoee River guided raft trip, July: Parksville Lake swim/cookout, August: Cherokee NF overnight camping, September: Coker Creek gold panning + hike, October: Fall foliage Cherohala Skyway drive + picnic, November: Thanksgiving week turkey trot trail run, December: Winter solstice bonfire at a member's property
- Partner with local outfitters for group rates (Ocoee Adventure Center, Hiwassee Outfitters, Ocoee Inn Rafting)
- Open to *anyone* — not just church people. Post on Voices of Athens Facebook, Meetup.com
- Carpooling coordinated via Discord `#basecamp`

**Success metric:** Average 10+ participants per outing. At least 30% are non-church-connected guests each month.

---

### POINT 7 — Community Servant Team at Athens Festivals
**Type:** Festival service presence | **Frequency:** 6–8 times per year (aligned with festival calendar)
**Location:** Downtown Athens and surrounding McMinn County communities

**What it is:** Instead of setting up a church booth at local festivals (nobody wants another church flyer), The Vine shows up to *serve the festival itself*. We volunteer with the festival organizers. We pick up trash. We help vendors set up and tear down. We hand out free water. We run the lost-and-found. We are the most helpful people at the festival — and we never mention church unless someone asks.

**Target festivals (see Section 2 for full calendar):**
- MooFest (June) — volunteer with Friendly City Festivals
- Sounds of Summer concerts (June–August) — help with setup/teardown at Market Park
- Battle of Athens Commemoration (August) — volunteer support
- Fried Green Tomato Festival (September) — volunteer support
- Pumpkintown (October) — volunteer with Friendly City Festivals
- Old Fashioned Downtown Christmas (November/December) — volunteer support

**Tactics:**
- Contact Friendly City Festivals (friendlycityfestivals.com) to volunteer as an organized group for MooFest and Pumpkintown
- Reach out to Main Street Athens for Sounds of Summer volunteer needs
- Create a simple, recognizable Vine volunteer look — dark green T-shirts with a small vine logo, nothing else. No Bible verses. No slogans. Just the vine.
- Train volunteers: "If someone asks who you're with, say 'The Vine — we're a local church.' If they ask more, tell them. If they don't, keep serving."
- After each festival, debrief as a team: What conversations happened? What needs did we see? How do we follow up?
- Key rule: **Never use service as a bait-and-switch.** People can smell inauthenticity. Serve because serving is what Jesus did, period.

**Success metric:** The festival organizers actively request our volunteer team for future events because we're reliable and genuinely helpful.

---

### POINT 8 — Free Monthly "Tech Help" Clinics
**Type:** Community service event | **Frequency:** Last Saturday of every month, 10:00 AM–1:00 PM
**Location:** E.G. Fisher Public Library community room (1289 Ingleside Ave, Athens)

**What it is:** Free, no-strings-attached tech help for anyone in the community. Bring your laptop that's running slow, your phone you can't figure out, your printer that won't connect, your questions about how to set up email or avoid scams. Vine members who work in IT volunteer their skills to help neighbors.

**Why it matters:** McMinn County has a significant population of older adults, low-income families, and rural residents who struggle with technology but can't afford Geek Squad or don't know who to trust. Athens has IT shops (Athens Electronics Repair, The Computer Works), but they charge for services. This is free, relational, and meets a real need.

**Tactics:**
- Partner with the E.G. Fisher Library — they already host community programming and have the space
- Recruit Vine members with IT skills: troubleshooting, phone setup, virus removal, Wi-Fi configuration, social media safety for seniors, email setup
- Create a simple intake form: What's the problem? What device? Name and phone number (for follow-up if needed)
- Promote through the library's channels, the Voices of Athens Facebook group, and senior centers
- Add a "Digital Literacy 101" mini-lesson each month: passwords, phishing, backups, privacy settings
- Hang a small sign: `hosted by volunteers from the vine — thevineathens.church`
- No evangelism during the clinic. If someone asks about the church, hand them a simple card with the website. Let the service speak.

**Success metric:** Helping 10–15 community members per clinic. Becoming the "go-to" people the library recommends for tech help.

---

### POINT 9 — "AMPLIFIED": Monthly Open Worship & Jam Night
**Type:** Monthly gathering | **Frequency:** Last Thursday of every month, 7:00–9:00 PM
**Location:** The Vine's meeting space (or rented venue — Arts Center Athens has rooms for 30–200)

**What it is:** An open-format evening of music, worship, and creative expression. Bring your guitar, bass, drums, keys, voice, laptop (electronic music welcome), or just come to listen. The first hour is collaborative jamming — any genre, any skill level. The second hour shifts into worship — acoustic, intimate, Spirit-led. No setlist. No production. Just people making music together and encountering God.

**Why it matters:** Athens has a music scene through the Sounds of Summer series and Cousin Jake Tullock Bluegrass Festival, but no regular open-mic or jam night that bridges secular and sacred music. Musicians who wouldn't walk into a Sunday morning service might show up for a jam session. And worship that emerges from authentic creative community hits different than a pre-programmed setlist.

**Tactics:**
- Provide a basic backline: PA system, drum kit, bass amp, guitar amps, keyboard
- All genres welcome in the jam half — blues, rock, country, metal, EDM, hip-hop. The only rule: respect the room
- During worship, keep it accessible — mostly simple songs people can sing along to, some spontaneous moments
- Reach out to TWU music students, local gigging musicians, Etowah Arts community
- Post on Craigslist musicians forum, Facebook musician groups, local music scene pages
- Record sessions (with permission) and post highlights to YouTube/Instagram
- This is *not* a church service with a jam tacked on. It's a creative community gathering where worship is a natural part of the evening.

**Success metric:** 15–25 people per night. At least 3–5 active musicians who aren't part of the Sunday worship team.

---

### POINT 10 — Strategic Presence at the Athens Farmers Market
**Type:** Recurring community presence | **Frequency:** Weekly during market season (June–October)
**Location:** Market Park, Athens — Tuesdays 2–6 PM and/or Saturdays 9 AM–12 PM

**What it is:** Not a church booth. A *useful* presence. Options:
- **Free cold brew station** — Vine members brew cold brew at home, bring it in dispensers, give it away for free. No strings attached. Just "Here, it's hot out. Have some cold brew."
- **Kids activity corner** — Simple crafts, sidewalk chalk, bubbles. Give parents 10 minutes to shop in peace.
- **Conversation table** — A small table with a sign: "Tell us about yourself. We're just here to listen." Two Vine members sit and genuinely listen to whoever wants to talk.

**Tactics:**
- Register with the Athens Farmers Market coordinator for a community (non-vendor) spot
- Rotate the offering: cold brew one week, kids activities the next, conversation the next
- Also attend the Food Hub Farmers Market (3rd Friday of each month, 3 W College St, 4–7 PM) — more intimate, artisan vibe
- Always have a few Vine cards available but never push them. If someone asks, share. If they don't, keep pouring coffee.
- Build relationships with the regular vendors. Know their names. Buy their produce. Be a *part* of the market, not a visitor to it.

**Success metric:** Market vendors and regulars recognize and greet Vine people by name.

---

### POINT 11 — Partnership with United Way Day of Caring
**Type:** Annual service event | **Frequency:** One day in September (2026 date TBD)
**Location:** Various sites across McMinn and Meigs Counties

**What it is:** United Way of McMinn and Meigs Counties organizes an annual Day of Caring — a single day where volunteer teams deploy to partner agencies across the county for hands-on service projects (painting, cleaning, landscaping, repairs, sorting, organizing). The Vine registers a team and shows up alongside other community groups to serve.

**Tactics:**
- Register a Vine team through United Way of McMinn & Meigs Counties (uwmcminn-meigs.com) — contact: 423-745-9606, 313 Maple St, Athens
- Request assignment to a partner agency that aligns with The Vine's heart: H.O.P.E. Center (domestic violence shelter), Good Faith Clinic (free healthcare for uninsured), or Tri-County Center (services for disabled adults)
- Make it a whole-Vine event — Sunday message that week ties into the Day of Caring theme
- Debrief afterward: What did we learn? What ongoing needs exist? Can we adopt this agency for year-round support?
- Also explore ongoing volunteer commitment with United Way's partner agencies beyond the one-day event
- Consider also participating in TWU's annual Day of Service (fall)

**Success metric:** Full team of 10–15 Vine volunteers. Relationship established with the assigned agency for ongoing partnership.

---

### POINT 12 — Athens Area Benevolence Network
**Type:** Ongoing community care | **Frequency:** As needs arise (responsive)
**Location:** Throughout Athens/McMinn County

**What it is:** A coordinated effort to meet tangible needs in the Athens community — not through a church fund that gives handouts, but through a *network* of skilled Vine members who can respond when real needs surface: car repairs, plumbing fixes, moving help, grocery runs, meal trains, resume help, interview prep, childcare during emergencies.

**Tactics:**
- Build an internal skills inventory: Who in The Vine can fix a car? Do plumbing? Cook a meal? Help with a resume? Watch kids? Mow a lawn? Set up a computer?
- Create a simple intake process: needs come in through the pastor, Branch leaders, or community partners (library, LTNP, United Way, schools)
- Respond within 48 hours. Speed matters when someone is in crisis.
- No hoops to jump through. No application form. No "are you a member" check. If someone needs help and we can help, we help.
- Partner with existing resources: McMinn County Resource Guide (published by the city — comprehensive list of 50+ agencies), Grace & Mercy Ministries, Coordinated Charities thrift store, Clean Living Athens (sober living), Women at the Well
- Track patterns: if the same need keeps coming up (e.g., car repairs), consider building a dedicated ministry around it
- This is not charity. This is neighboring.

**Success metric:** Vine members can articulate: "When someone in Athens needs help, they know they can call us." Response rate: 90%+ within 48 hours.

---

### POINT 13 — Quarterly "Theology on Tap" Nights
**Type:** Quarterly event | **Frequency:** Once per quarter (January, April, July, October)
**Location:** The Social on Depot Hill (craft cocktails/pizza) or a similar casual venue

**What it is:** An informal evening where 15–30 people gather at a local restaurant/bar to discuss big questions over food and drinks. Not a Bible study. Not a sermon. A *conversation* with a topic and a facilitator. Topics drawn from the intersection of faith, culture, technology, and life:

- *"Is AI going to replace God?"* — Technology, consciousness, and the soul
- *"Why do good people suffer?"* — Theodicy for people who've been through it
- *"Church hurt is real — now what?"* — Honest conversation about religious trauma
- *"Can you be a Christian and ___?"* — Fill in the blank. Tattooed? Gay? A Democrat? A Republican? A gamer who plays violent games? An atheist who's curious?
- *"What does the Bible actually say about [hot topic]?"* — Bring your questions. All of them.
- *"Faith and mental health"* — Anxiety, depression, and the church's failures

**Tactics:**
- Facilitator sets the table but doesn't dominate. 15-minute intro, then open discussion.
- Ground rules: Respect. Listen. No one gets shut down for asking an honest question. We disagree well.
- Promote through all Vine channels plus Voices of Athens FB, TWU campus, and word of mouth
- Buy appetizers for the table. People who show up buy their own drinks.
- No closing prayer unless the room asks for one. Let the Spirit move without forcing the format.

**Success metric:** Consistent attendance of 15–30. At least half are people who don't attend Sunday services anywhere.

---

### POINT 14 — TWU Campus Engagement Strategy
**Type:** Ongoing relational presence | **Frequency:** Weekly during academic year
**Location:** Tennessee Wesleyan University campus, Athens

**What it is:** A consistent, non-predatory presence on the TWU campus. Not a campus ministry that competes with existing student organizations. A *relationship* where Vine members (especially younger adults, tech professionals, creatives) are known and trusted by students.

**Tactics:**
- Attend TWU public events: concerts, plays, lectures, athletic games. Be visible as community supporters, not recruiters.
- Offer free resume workshops and mock interviews for graduating seniors (led by Vine members who hire people)
- Host a monthly off-campus dinner for TWU students at a Vine member's home — home-cooked meal, no agenda
- Connect with TWU's Social Work Club, Criminal Justice Society, and other service-oriented organizations
- Offer Respawn game nights as an alternative Friday activity for students
- If TWU has a chapel program, offer to participate as guests (not as church planters — as fellow Christians in the community)
- Respect boundaries: TWU is a United Methodist-affiliated institution. We are guests. We complement, not compete.

**Success metric:** TWU students describe The Vine as "those cool people from the church that actually cares about us."

---

### POINT 15 — "ROOT ACCESS": Men's Group Built Around Shared Work
**Type:** Ongoing small group | **Frequency:** Biweekly Saturday mornings, 7:00–9:00 AM
**Location:** A member's garage, workshop, or local maker space

**What it is:** A men's group that isn't just sitting in a circle talking about feelings (though that happens too). It's built around *doing things together*: woodworking projects, car maintenance, home repair skills, welding, 3D printing, electronics projects. Work with your hands while you talk about life, faith, struggles, and growth. Modeled after the biblical pattern of discipleship — Jesus taught while walking and working, not while sitting in rows.

**Tactics:**
- Each session: 30 minutes of project work (shared or individual), 30 minutes of honest conversation (check-in, prayer, Scripture), 30 minutes of coffee and fellowship
- Rotate projects: build a bookshelf, change brake pads, solder a Raspberry Pi project, sharpen knives, leather working
- Skills teaching: men who know things teach men who want to learn. Intergenerational by design.
- This is where the "tattooed and pierced" and "motorcycle club members" feel most at home — doing something with their hands alongside other men who get it
- Consider partnering with TCAT Athens (they have welding, machine tool, and industrial programs) for occasional facility access or guest instructors
- The name "Root Access" is deliberately tech-flavored — it means administrator-level access. In this context: access to the deepest parts of who you are.

**Success metric:** 8–12 consistent men. Conversations go deep. Men bring friends.

---

### POINT 16 — "WILDFLOWER": Women's Community
**Type:** Ongoing community | **Frequency:** Biweekly, alternating formats
**Location:** Rotating homes, coffee shops, and venues

**What it is:** A women's community that rejects the "women's ministry" stereotype of pastel colors and surface-level devotionals. Wildflower is for women who are fierce, broken, creative, working, parenting, struggling, thriving — and who want to be *known*, not just attended to.

**Tactics:**
- Alternating format: Week A is a home gathering (dinner, real conversation, prayer). Week B is an outing (hiking, art class at Arts Center Athens, pottery, axe throwing, cooking class, escape room)
- Led by women, shaped by the women who attend. No predetermined curriculum. The group decides what they study, discuss, and do.
- Intentionally multigenerational: college students alongside grandmothers. Women learn from women.
- Tackle hard topics: body image, purity culture damage, career and calling, motherhood pressure, singleness, faith deconstruction
- Create a private GroupMe or Discord channel for daily check-ins and encouragement
- Open to any woman — church-connected or not. Invite friends who would *never* go to a women's Bible study but who desperately need community.

**Success metric:** Women describe Wildflower as "the safest place I've ever been." Growth through word of mouth, not promotion.

---

### POINT 17 — Neighborhood Cookout Series (Rotating Locations)
**Type:** Quarterly event | **Frequency:** Once per quarter (weather permitting)
**Location:** Rotating through Athens neighborhoods — member backyards, apartment complex common areas, public parks

**What it is:** Old-school neighboring. Fire up the grill, set out lawn chairs, put up a canopy, and invite the neighbors. No program. No worship set. No testimony time. Just hamburgers, hot dogs, sides, and conversation. Every person who lives within earshot is invited.

**Tactics:**
- Identify 4 Vine members in different Athens neighborhoods willing to host (or co-host) one cookout per year
- Door-knock or doorhang invitations to every house on the block: "Your neighbors are throwing a cookout. Come eat free food and meet the people you wave at."
- Include kid-friendly activities: cornhole, kickball, water balloons in summer
- Vine members attend as *neighbors*, not as church representatives. If church comes up, great. If not, we made 20 new acquaintances.
- Target underserved neighborhoods and apartment complexes — places where community events don't happen and isolation is highest
- Consider partnering with Athens Parks & Recreation for permits at Cook Park or City Park pavilions
- Photograph (with permission) and share on social media — model what authentic community looks like

**Success metric:** Each cookout draws 30+ people from the immediate neighborhood. Vine members develop at least 3 ongoing neighborly relationships per event.

---

### POINT 18 — Strategic Volunteerism with Existing Nonprofits
**Type:** Ongoing partnerships | **Frequency:** Year-round, rotating focus
**Location:** Various Athens/McMinn County agencies

**What it is:** Rather than creating new programs, The Vine embeds volunteers into organizations that are *already doing the work*. We don't reinvent the wheel. We become the most reliable volunteers these organizations have ever had.

**Priority partnerships (from McMinn County Resource Guide):**
| Organization | Focus | What We Can Do |
|---|---|---|
| **H.O.P.E. Center** | Domestic violence shelter/child advocacy | Meal preparation, facility maintenance, donation drives |
| **Good Faith Clinic** | Free healthcare for uninsured | Reception desk volunteers, fundraiser support |
| **Athens-McMinn Family YMCA** | Youth programs, community health | Youth mentoring, coaching, event support |
| **CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates)** | Child advocacy in foster care | Train Vine members to become certified CASA volunteers |
| **Foster Village East TN** | Foster family support | Provide respite care, supply closet donations |
| **McMinn County Senior Activity Center** | Senior services | Tech help (connects to Point 8), companionship visits, transportation |
| **Kids Care Closet (Athens City Schools)** | Clothing for students in need | Seasonal clothing drives, sorting and organizing |

**Tactics:**
- Assign a "partnership coordinator" from The Vine to each agency — one person who maintains the relationship and schedules volunteers
- Don't overcommit. Better to serve one agency exceptionally than five agencies poorly.
- Start with 2–3 partnerships in year one. Add more as capacity grows.
- Annual "Service Spotlight" — feature a different partner agency in the Sunday gathering (invite their director to share their story, not for money, but for awareness)
- Rule: We serve under *their* banner, not ours. This isn't about The Vine getting credit.

**Success metric:** Partner agencies describe The Vine as "the most dependable volunteers we have."

---

### POINT 19 — Digital Presence & Content Strategy
**Type:** Ongoing digital outreach | **Frequency:** Daily/weekly
**Location:** Online — Discord, Instagram, YouTube, Website, Facebook

**What it is:** A digital strategy that doesn't feel like a church social media account. No "Happy Sunday!" posts with stock photos. Instead: content that reflects who The Vine actually is and speaks the language of our target communities.

**Channels & Content:**

| Channel | Purpose | Content Type |
|---|---|---|
| **Discord Server** | Central hub for all Vine communities | Channels for each group (#terminal, #respawn, #iron-horse, #basecamp, #amplified, etc.), prayer requests, general chat, memes |
| **Instagram** | Visual storytelling | Behind-the-scenes of events, short-form video (Reels), member spotlights (with permission), Ocoee region beauty shots, memes that land |
| **YouTube** | Long-form content | Amplified worship sessions, Theology on Tap highlights (podcast-style), sermon clips (not full sermons — 5–10 min highlights), Basecamp adventure vlogs |
| **Website** | Home base | Event calendar, group info, beliefs, contact form, blog/articles |
| **Facebook** | Community connection | Event promotion in Voices of Athens group, local engagement |

**Tactics:**
- Discord is primary. This is where our communities live. Every group has a channel. Real-time conversation happens here.
- Instagram: Post 3–5 times per week. Use Reels. Show real faces, real moments, real mess.
- YouTube: Upload 2–4 times per month. Amplified sessions, Theology on Tap discussions, and one "from the pastor" video per month (raw, unscripted, shot on a phone)
- Console easter egg in the website source code is already there (Konami code unlocks a message)
- Respond to every DM and comment personally. No canned responses.
- Meme game must be strong. This community communicates in memes. Learn the language.

**Success metric:** Discord server reaches 100+ members within 12 months. Instagram engagement rate exceeds 5%.

---

### POINT 20 — Monthly "Interest Meetings" (The Open Table)
**Type:** Monthly open gathering | **Frequency:** One Sunday per month after the regular gathering, 12:30 PM
**Location:** Wherever The Vine meets, or a nearby restaurant

**What it is:** A standing open invitation for *anyone* — visitor, regular, skeptic, curious neighbor — to sit down over lunch and hear The Vine's story, ask questions, and explore whether this community is for them. Not a membership class. Not a commitment pitch. An open table.

**Format (90 minutes):**
1. **Lunch together** (30 min) — Provided free. Eat, chat, get comfortable.
2. **"Here's who we are"** (20 min) — Pastor shares The Vine's story, values, beliefs (Vineyard + AG roots), and vision. Honest about what we are and what we're not.
3. **"Here's where you might fit"** (15 min) — Overview of all the groups and opportunities: Terminal, Respawn, Iron Horse, Basecamp, Branches, Amplified, Root Access, Wildflower, volunteer partnerships.
4. **"Ask us anything"** (25 min) — Open Q&A. Nothing is off-limits. "Why should I trust a church?" "What do you believe about ___?" "I was hurt by a church before — why is this different?" All fair game.

**Tactics:**
- Promote every Sunday: "If you're new, curious, or just want to know more — Open Table is next Sunday after service."
- Keep it intimate — cap at 20 people per session so conversation stays personal
- Always have 3–4 Vine regulars at the table alongside newcomers — not to sell, but to share their honest experience
- For people who express interest in Branches (discipleship), connect them with a group leader within 48 hours
- For people who express interest in serving, connect them with the relevant group leader that week
- Follow up with every attendee within 3 days — a personal text or call, not an email blast

**Success metric:** 50%+ of Open Table attendees take a next step (join a Branch, attend a group, come back to Sunday gathering) within 30 days.

## SECTION 2: MONTHLY COMMUNITY EVENT ENGAGEMENT CALENDAR

One community event per month, twelve months a year. The Vine shows up, serves, and participates — not as a church with an agenda, but as neighbors who care about their town.

## SECTION 4: GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR ALL OUTREACH

1. **Serve first. Always.** The moment we serve in order to recruit, we've lost the plot.

2. **Relationships over attendance.** We measure success by depth of relationship, not headcount.

3. **Be where people are.** Don't ask them to come to us. Go to them. The coffee shop. The festival. The trailhead. The game store.

4. **Respect existing communities.** The library D&D group, the Roughnecks MC, the Farmers Market vendors — they were here first. We join, not replace.

5. **Earn trust slowly.** Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets. Show up consistently for 6 months before expecting anyone to care who we are.

6. **No bait-and-switch.** If we say it's a game night, it's a game night. If we say it's a cookout, it's a cookout. We never ambush people with a gospel presentation they didn't sign up for.

7. **Let the Spirit work.** If we are who we say we are — authentic, loving, present — people will ask questions. We trust God to open doors. We don't kick them down.

8. **Embrace the weird.** The Vine is for people who don't fit in. That means *we* might not look like a "normal" church. Good. Normal church has failed these people. Let's be something different.

9. **Everyone has a gift.** Outreach isn't the pastor's job. It's *everyone's* job, using *their* gifts. The coder hosts Terminal. The biker leads Iron Horse. The gamer runs Respawn. The cook feeds the neighborhood.

10. **Stay rooted.** All of this activity means nothing if we're not connected to the Vine. Prayer, Scripture, worship, discipleship — these are the roots. The outreach is the fruit. Don't confuse the two.

---

*"Apart from me you can do nothing."*
*But connected to the Vine? Watch what grows.*
