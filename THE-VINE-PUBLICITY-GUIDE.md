## 1. LOCAL PRINT MEDIA

### The Daily Post-Athenian
**The** local newspaper. Everyone in Athens over 40 reads it. Many under 40 follow it on Facebook.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Daily newspaper (print + online) |
| **Coverage** | Athens, McMinn County, Meigs County |
| **Address** | 416 S. White Street, Athens, TN 37303 (P.O. Box 340, 37371) |
| **Phone** | (423) 745-5664 |
| **Fax** | (423) 745-8295 |
| **Website** | [dailypostathenian.com](https://www.dailypostathenian.com/) |
| **Facebook** | [facebook.com/dailypostathenian](https://www.facebook.com/dailypostathenian) — 17,000+ followers |
| **Owner** | Adams Publishing Group |
| **Event submissions** | Via Evvnt platform on their site (may have fees for promoted placement) |

**How to use it:**

- **Community calendar listings** — Submit events for their calendar section. Basic listings are often free; promoted placements have fees. Contact the office to ask about community/church event policy.
- **Press releases** — For major events (Respawn launch, MooFest volunteer team, Tech Help clinic launch), write a short press release and email it to the newsroom. Local papers are hungry for genuinely interesting community stories. Frame it as news, not church advertising: *"Local group launches free monthly tech help clinic at Athens library"* gets printed. *"New church invites you to services"* does not.
- **Classified/display advertising** — Paid ads for ongoing event promotion. Useful for establishing consistent presence (e.g., a small weekly ad for Sunday gathering times).
- **Feature story pitches** — Pitch The Vine's story to a reporter. Angle: *"Non-traditional church plants roots in Athens — targets gamers, bikers, and IT workers"* is a story the Post-Athenian would run because it's genuinely unusual and local.
- **Letters to the editor / community columns** — Write occasional columns on community topics (not church recruitment).

**Estimated costs:**
- Community calendar listing: Free to low cost
- Classified ad: $15–$40 per insertion
- Display ad (quarter page): $150–$400 per run
- Feature story: Free (if they choose to write it)

---

### Advocate & Democrat (Monroe County)
Adjacent county newspaper covering Tellico Plains, Madisonville, Sweetwater — overlapping audience for outdoor events (Basecamp, Iron Horse rides through Cherokee NF).
- Website: [advocateanddemocrat.com](https://www.advocateanddemocrat.com/)

## 2. LOCAL RADIO

Athens has three hometown radio stations. In a town of ~14,000, radio still reaches a huge percentage of the population — especially commuters, older adults, and blue-collar workers.

### WYXI 1390 AM / 94.5 FM
**The** local voice of Athens since 1966. 59+ years of live & local radio.

| Detail | Info |
|---|---|
| **Format** | Oldies, talk, local personalities, news, community |
| **Signature show** | "Trading Post" — live buy/sell/trade call-in |
| **Website** | [wyxi.net](https://www.wyxi.net/) |
| **Phone** | (423) 745-1390 |
| **Email** | wyxiradio@gmail.com |
| **Listen live** | Via website or TuneIn |

**How to use it:**
- **Community calendar announcements** — WYXI reads community event announcements on air. Call or email event details. This is typically free for nonprofit/community events.
- **Interview/talk show appearances** — Offer the pastor or a group leader as a guest to talk about a specific initiative. Angle: not "come to our church" but "we're launching free tech help for seniors at the library" or "here's a new gaming community for Athens." Make it about the community.
- **Trading Post tie-in** — If The Vine is doing a gear swap, charity sale, or giveaway, the Trading Post format is perfect.
- **Paid spots** — Short radio ads (15s or 30s) for specific events. Radio ads in small markets like Athens are surprisingly affordable.

**Estimated costs:**
- Community announcements: Free
- 30-second spot: $15–$40 per airing
- Package deal (multiple spots/week): $100–$300/month

### WJSQ 101.7 FM / WLAR 1450 AM (95.1 FM)
**Format:** Country, classic hits, local news, McMinn County sports
**Facebook:** [facebook.com/wjsq.wlar](https://www.facebook.com/wjsq.wlar)

Same playbook as WYXI. These stations often pair together for local coverage. Great for reaching the country music / working-class audience — which overlaps significantly with the biker and blue-collar communities The Vine wants to reach.

### WKPJ-LP 104.5 FM
**Format:** Christian radio (low-power)

May be open to partnership for Amplified worship night promotions, Sunday gathering info, or community service announcements. Contact for programming opportunities.

---

## 3. REGIONAL TELEVISION

Athens doesn't have its own TV stations, but Chattanooga stations (45 miles away) regularly cover McMinn County. For *major* events or human-interest stories, a TV pitch is worth attempting.

| Station | Coverage | McMinn County Page |
|---|---|---|
| **WDEF News 12** (CBS, Chattanooga) | McMinn County beat | [wdef.com/category/mcminn-county](https://www.wdef.com/category/mcminn-county) |
| **News Channel 9 / WTVC** (ABC, Chattanooga) | Regional news | [newschannel9.com](https://newschannel9.com) — search "McMinn County" |
| **FOX Chattanooga / WTVC** | Regional news | [foxchattanooga.com](https://foxchattanooga.com) — search "McMinn County" |

**How to use it:**
- Television is for *exceptional* stories only. Don't pitch Sunday services. Pitch:
  - "Church launches free tech repair clinics for McMinn County seniors"
  - "Athens gaming community finds home in unconventional church"
  - "Local church deploys 15 volunteers for MooFest — not for recruitment, just to pick up trash"
  - "Motorcycle fellowship rides Ocoee corridor every month — 'no patches, no politics'"
- Write a tight pitch email (3 paragraphs max) and send to assignment desks.
- Offer a visual — TV needs footage. "We have 20 bikers riding through the Ocoee at sunrise" is a story. "We had a meeting" is not.

**Estimated cost:** Free (earned media)

## 4. COMMUNITY EVENT CALENDARS (ONLINE — FREE)

This is the single highest-ROI move for event publicity in Athens. These calendars are interconnected through the **Locable** platform — create one account and your events can appear across multiple Athens/McMinn sites.

### Primary Calendars (via Locable — FREE)

| Calendar | URL | Signup Link |
|---|---|---|
| **Main Street Athens TN** | [mainstreetathens.org/calendar](https://www.mainstreetathens.org/calendar) | [Locable signup](https://impact.locable.com/users/sign_up/?invite_token=jm2898mx) |

**Action item:** Assign one person as "Calendar Coordinator." Their job: submit every Vine event to all 7+ calendars at least 2 weeks before the event. This is unglamorous, essential work.

---

## 5. FACEBOOK GROUPS (THE ATHENS GOLDMINE)

Facebook is the dominant social platform in Athens, TN. These groups are where the community actually *talks*. This is not optional — if The Vine isn't in these groups, we're invisible to half the town.

### Primary Community Groups

| Group Name | URL | Members (est.) | Notes |

| Page | URL |
|---|---|

| **Roughnecks MC Bradley-Meigs** | Search Facebook/Instagram |

### Facebook Group Rules of Engagement

1. **Join all of the above groups.** Have 2–3 Vine members in each one so we're not relying on one person.
2. **Be a member first, a promoter second.** Answer questions. Comment on posts. Help people. Be *known* in the group before you ever post a Vine event.
3. **Respect group rules.** Most have rules about promotional posts. Read them. Follow them. If a group says "no church ads," don't post church ads. Post about a free gaming night or a free tech help clinic — that's a community event, not a church ad.
4. **Post as a person, not as a brand.** "Hey everyone, I'm hosting a free game night this Friday — board games, console tournaments, snacks. Come hang out!" reads completely different from "The Vine Church invites you to our monthly Respawn event."
5. **Use images.** Facebook's algorithm crushes text-only posts. Every event post needs an eye-catching graphic.
6. **Timing matters.** Post Tuesday–Thursday for best visibility. Avoid weekends (lower engagement). Post between 9–11 AM or 6–8 PM.
7. **Reply to every comment.** Someone asks "What kind of games?" — answer within 30 minutes.

## 6. NEXTDOOR APP

Nextdoor is hyperlocal — posts go to your actual neighbors within a defined radius. Active in Athens with 5,000+ residents across multiple neighborhoods.

### Athens Nextdoor Neighborhoods

| Neighborhood | URL |
|---|---|
| **Athens (main)** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/athens--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/athens--athens--tn) |
| **North Athens** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/northathens--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/northathens--athens--tn) |
| **The Highlands** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/thehighlandsathens--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/thehighlandsathens--athens--tn) |
| **Downtown & E Madison** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/downtownemadison--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/downtownemadison--athens--tn) |
| **City Park** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/cityparktn--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/cityparktn--athens--tn) |
| **Sweetfield Valley** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/sweetfieldvalley--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/sweetfieldvalley--athens--tn) |
| **Cumberland** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/cumberlandtn--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/cumberlandtn--athens--tn) |
| **Rogers Creek** | [nextdoor.com/neighborhood/rogerscreek--athens--tn](https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/rogerscreek--athens--tn) |
| **Forrest Estates** | Search Nextdoor |

**How to use it:**
- Create a Nextdoor account (requires address verification — takes 1–2 weeks via postcard)
- Post in the **Events** category, not as a general post (avoids being flagged as spam)
- Best for: Neighborhood cookouts, Tech Help clinics, Farmers Market presence, Sunday gathering invites
- Tone: neighborly, not promotional. "Hey neighbors — we're doing a free cookout Saturday at the park. Everyone's invited. Burgers on us."
- Nextdoor has a **Business page** option — register The Vine as a local business/organization for additional posting capabilities
- **Do not spam.** One post per event. Nextdoor communities are aggressive about flagging over-posters.

## 7. NATIONAL EVENT PLATFORMS

### Eventbrite
- **URL:** [eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
- **Cost:** Free for free events
- **Athens events page:** [eventbrite.com/d/tn--athens/events](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/tn--athens/events)
- **Use for:** Every public Vine event — Respawn, Basecamp, Theology on Tap, Tech Help clinics, cookouts. Even free events benefit from an Eventbrite listing because it gives people a way to RSVP, shows up in Google search, and provides you with attendee data.
- **Tip:** Use the "recurring event" feature for monthly events.

### Meetup
- **URL:** [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)
- **Athens page:** [meetup.com/find/us--tn--athens](https://www.meetup.com/find/us--tn--athens)
- **Cost:** Organizer subscription ~$17/month (free for attendees)
- **Use for:** Create a "The Vine Athens" group or separate groups: "Athens Code & Coffee" (Terminal), "Athens Game Night" (Respawn), "SE TN Motorcycle Rides" (Iron Horse). Meetup indexes well in Google and reaches people *actively searching* for community.
- **Key insight:** Athens has almost NO active Meetup groups. Creating one for any of these niches puts The Vine at the top of search results for anyone in the area looking for community.

### Google Business Profile
- **URL:** [business.google.com](https://business.google.com/)
- **Cost:** Free
- **Use for:** Register The Vine as a local church/organization. This controls the Google Maps listing, Knowledge Panel, and local search results. **Critical** for "churches near me" searches.
- **Actions:** Add photos, service times, events (Google Posts), website link, phone number. Encourage reviews from members.

### Google Events
- Events posted to your Google Business Profile appear in Google Search results when people search for events in Athens. Free and automatic if you use Google Posts.

## 8. PHYSICAL BULLETIN BOARDS & FLYER LOCATIONS

In a town like Athens, physical flyers still work — especially for reaching people who aren't chronically online.

### Confirmed/Likely Bulletin Board Locations

| Location | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **E.G. Fisher Public Library** | 1289 Ingleside Ave, Athens | Community hub. Ask staff about posting policy. They host community programming and likely have a public board. Phone: (423) 745-7782 |
| **Athens-McMinn Family YMCA** | 205 Knoxville Ave, Athens | Locals confirm this has a community bulletin board. Great for families/fitness crowd. |
| **McMinn Senior Activity Center** | 205 McMinn Ave, Athens | Perfect for Tech Help clinic flyers. Serves 50+ adults. Phone: (423) 745-6830 |
| **Athens Regional Park / SE TN Trade & Conference Center** | 122 Regional Park Dr, Athens | City recreation hub. Check main building for boards. |
| **City Hall** | 815 N. Jackson St, Athens | Public building — likely has a community board in the lobby. |
| **McMinn County Courthouse** | 6 E Madison Ave, Athens | Public building with foot traffic. |

### Retail/Commercial Locations (Ask Permission)

| **Tattoo shops** | *If Athens has any* — perfect for The Vine's target demographic. Ask if they'll keep cards at the counter. |
| **Auto repair shops** | Perfect for Iron Horse and Root Access audience |

### Flyer Design Principles

- **Keep it simple.** One event per flyer. Large font. Minimal text.
- **Include a QR code** linking to Eventbrite/Discord/website — bridges physical to digital
- **On-brand design:** Dark background, vine green accent, JetBrains Mono font. Match the website aesthetic.
- **No churchy clip art.** No crosses. No stock photos of diverse smiling people. Clean, modern, tech-adjacent design.
- **Tear-off tabs** at the bottom with the event URL or Discord invite link
- **Size:** Standard 8.5"x11" for bulletin boards. 4"x6" postcards for counter cards.

## 9. TENNESSEE WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

TWU has ~1,000 students and a captive audience of young adults — prime Vine demographic.

### Advertising on Campus

| Method | How | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| **Bulletin boards** | Flyers/posters on designated boards (not on glass, wood, or painted surfaces) | **Must be approved by the Student Life Office** before posting. Contact them first. |
| **Student Life Office** | Request event promotion through official channels | They can distribute announcements via email or social media to students |
| **Director of Marketing & Communications** | Pitch stories/events for TWU website and media | Good for Tech Help clinics, Respawn, or community service events |
| **Student organizations** | Partner with clubs for co-promotion | Baptist Collegiate Ministry, Delight Ministries, Criminal Justice Society, Social Work Club, Chess Club — all relevant |
| **SGA (Student Government Association)** | Request inclusion in student announcements | If Vine events are open to students and the broader community |

### Key Contacts
- **Student Life Office / Director of Student Involvement** — for event scheduling, flyer approval, org connections
- **VP for Student Life** — major event approvals
- **Center for Service and Leadership** — for volunteer partnerships (Love Thy Neighbor, Day of Service)
- **Main website:** [tnwesleyan.edu](https://www.tnwesleyan.edu/)

### Best Events to Promote on Campus
- **Respawn** (game nights) — college students live for this
- **Terminal** (Code & Coffee) — CS and tech students
- **Theology on Tap** — questioning, exploring faith
- **Basecamp** (outdoor adventures) — young adults love Ocoee trips
- **Open Table** (interest meetings) — low-pressure way to check out The Vine
- **Amplified** (jam nights) — music students
- **Free food events** (cookouts, Open Table lunches) — universal college student draw

## 10. COFFEE SHOPS & LOCAL BUSINESSES

These are relationship-first venues. Don't just drop off flyers — become a regular, build a relationship with the owner, *then* ask about promoting events.

### Coffee Shops

| Name | Address | Opportunity |
|---|---|---|
| **Blue Front Coffee Co.** | 5 W College St | **Terminal home base.** Partner with the owner. Leave Vine cards at the counter. Ask about a small standing sign on Terminal Wednesdays. |
| **Revival Grounds** | Athens | Similar partnership opportunity. |
| **Cup Runneth Over Coffeehouse** | Athens | Ask about counter card placement. |
| **Maddi Mae's Café & Creamery** | Athens | Café + ice cream — family crowd. Good for cookout/Basecamp flyers. |
| **Thrive Community Church Coffee Shop** | Athens (Tues–Thurs 9am–5pm) | Interesting — another church-connected coffee space. Could be collaborative, not competitive. |

### Restaurants & Gathering Spots

| Name | Opportunity |
|---|---|
| **The Social on Depot Hill** | Theology on Tap venue. Ask about event promotion on their social media / in-house signage. |
| **Pie Hound Pizza Company** | Community vibe. Counter cards, possible Respawn after-party sponsor. |
| **Open Door Cafe** | Casual dining — counter card placement. |
| **Jenkins Grille & Market** | Community spot — explore co-promotion. |

### The LITE House (Coworking Space)
- **Address:** Athens (check yourlitehouse.com)
- **Opportunity:** **Critical for Terminal.** This is where remote workers and entrepreneurs work. Leave cards/flyers. Ask about presenting Terminal at a community event. Some coworking spaces have member newsletters — ask to be included.

## 11. OUTDOOR ADVERTISING — BILLBOARDS & SIGNAGE

### Billboard Companies Serving Athens

| Company | Contact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Gresco Outdoor Advertising** | 724C S Congress Pkwy, Athens, TN 37303. Phone: (423) 744-9809. Mobile: (423) 829-1298. Email: grescoadv@gmail.com | **Local company since 1977.** Personal service. Best starting point for Athens billboard inventory. |
| **Lamar Advertising** | Phone: (706) 543-0380. Web: [lamar.com/athens](https://lamar.com/athens) | National company with Athens inventory. Digital and static billboards. |
| **Selective Structures LLC** | 811 East Ave, Athens, TN 37303. Phone: (800) 459-6670 | Custom sign/billboard fabrication — for if you're building your own signage. |

### Estimated Billboard Costs (McMinn County, per 4 weeks)

| Type | Cost Range |
|---|---|
| Digital billboard (8-second slot, 64-second loop) | $1,690 – $5,765 |
| Static bulletin (large) | $1,396 – $5,485 |
| Poster (smaller) | $561 – $892 |
| Design/fabrication for static | ~$850 one-time |

**Strategy:**
- Billboards are expensive for a startup church. Use them sparingly and strategically.
- **Best use case:** A single, simple billboard for 1–2 months to establish awareness: `the vine // where misfits find family // sundays 10:30am // thevineathens.church`
- **Placement:** Decatur Pike or Highway 30 — main traffic corridors into Athens.
- **Design:** Dark background, vine green text, minimal. Match the website. No stock photos. No "Join us this Sunday!" cheese.
- **Alternative:** A well-placed poster-size board ($560/month) near the high school, TCAT, or TWU.
- Use quotes from [AdQuick.com](https://www.adquick.com/billboard-cost/athens-city-tennessee) or [BillboardsIn.com](https://www.billboardsin.com/market/athens-tennessee/billboards/37303) for specific availability.

## 12. YARD SIGNS & BANNERS

The most cost-effective physical advertising available. Perfect for event-specific promotion.

### Local Printers

### Yard Sign Strategy

- **Permanent location signs:** If The Vine has a building, 2–3 yard signs at nearby intersections during Sunday mornings.
- **Neighborhood cookout signs:** Place in the host's yard and at nearby intersections the week of the event.
- **Design:** Same brand standards — dark green background, white/light text, QR code. Simple. Readable from a car at 35mph. Maximum 8 words.

### Banners

## 13. THE VINE'S OWNED DIGITAL CHANNELS

These are channels The Vine controls entirely — no algorithm gatekeepers, no group admin approval needed.

### Discord Server (Primary Hub)

The heartbeat of The Vine's online community. Every group has a channel. This is where daily conversation happens.

| Channel | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `#welcome` | New member onboarding, rules, intro |
| `#announcements` | Official event announcements — every event posts here |
| `#general` | Open conversation |
| `#prayer-requests` | Self-explanatory |
| `#terminal` | Code & Coffee community |
| `#respawn` | Gaming community, LFG threads |
| `#iron-horse` | Ride planning, weather calls, route sharing |
| `#basecamp` | Adventure planning, photos, carpooling |
| `#amplified` | Music sharing, jam night coordination |
| `#root-access` | Men's group |
| `#wildflower` | Women's group |
| `#theology` | Ongoing faith discussions |
| `#memes` | Non-negotiable. This community runs on memes. |
| `#local-events` | Athens community events of interest |

**Promotion:** Put the Discord invite link on everything — website, flyers, social media bios, QR codes, table cards at events. Discord is how people stay after they visit once.

### Website — thevineathens.church

Already built. Ensure it includes:
- Events calendar (keep it current — nothing kills credibility like an outdated events page)
- Group descriptions with next meeting dates
- Contact form
- Discord invite link (prominent)
- SEO basics: meta descriptions, local keywords ("church Athens TN," "game night Athens Tennessee," "motorcycle group Ocoee")

### Instagram — @thevineathens

| Content Type | Frequency | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Event announcements** | 2–3x/week | Designed graphics matching brand standards |

| **Memes** | 1–2x/week | Faith + nerd culture crossover. Know your audience. |
| **Ocoee/nature** | 1x/week | Beautiful region photography — positions The Vine as connected to the land |

**Hashtag strategy:** `#thevineathens` `#athenstn` `#mcminncounty` `#ocoeeriver` `#gamersofathens` `#churchfortherestofus` `#wheremisfitsfindfamily`

## 15. WORD OF MOUTH & RELATIONAL INVITATIONS

The most powerful channel of all. Research consistently shows that **personal invitation** is the #1 reason people visit a new church or community group. All the billboards and Facebook posts in the world don't match a friend saying "Hey, you should come with me this Friday."

### Equipping Vine Members for Natural Invitations

- **Give them language.** Many people want to invite friends but don't know what to say. Provide simple scripts:
  - "We do this game night thing once a month — free snacks, console tournaments, board games. You should come."
  - "A bunch of us ride through the Ocoee on Saturdays. You ride? Come join."
  - "Some of us meet for coffee and coding on Wednesdays. It's super chill. You'd fit right in."
- **Give them tools.** Business-card-sized invite cards with:
  - Event name and date
  - Location
  - QR code to Discord or Eventbrite
  - Website URL
  - Tagline: "where misfits find family"
- **Normalize invitation.** Talk about it from the platform: "Who are you going to bring next month?" Not as guilt — as excitement.
- **Personal follow-up.** When someone visits, a Vine member texts them within 24 hours: "It was great meeting you. Hope you had fun. You're always welcome."

### The "Plus One" Challenge
Once per quarter, challenge every Vine member to bring one friend to one event — not Sunday, just any event. Respawn, Basecamp, a cookout. Lower the barrier. Track results.

## 16. STRATEGIC CROSS-PROMOTION WITH PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS

Partner organizations have their own audiences. When The Vine serves faithfully, these partners will *want* to promote Vine events to their people.

| Partner | Their Audience | Cross-Promotion Opportunity |
|---|---|---|
| **E.G. Fisher Public Library** | Entire community (library patrons, program attendees) | Library promotes Tech Help clinic on their channels; promotes Respawn to Tabletop Guild members |
| **Love Thy Neighbor Project (TWU)** | Food bank clients, TWU students, donors | LTNP promotes volunteer opportunities that feed Vine's service pipeline |
| **United Way McMinn & Meigs** | Nonprofit network, corporate partners, volunteers | UW promotes Day of Caring participation; Vine promoted in partner newsletters |
| **Friendly City Festivals** | Festival attendees (6,000–16,000) | Festival acknowledges volunteer teams in programs, social media |
| **Athens-McMinn YMCA** | Families, fitness community | YMCA promotes family-friendly Vine events (cookouts, Basecamp family outings) |
| **Blue Front Coffee Co.** | Daily coffee customers | Counter cards, Instagram co-posts for Terminal Wednesdays |
| **The Social on Depot Hill** | Dining/nightlife crowd | Social promotes Theology on Tap events on their page |
| **Main Street Athens** | Downtown business network | Events appear on Main Street calendar; potential for co-branded downtown events |
| **TCAT Athens** | Trade school students (IT, welding, machine tool) | TCAT promotes Terminal and Root Access to relevant students |

**The key:** Cross-promotion only works when the relationship is genuine. Serve first. Promote later.

## 17. GUERRILLA & CREATIVE TACTICS

These are the ideas that don't fit neatly into categories but can punch way above their weight.

### 1. QR Code Stickers
Print 500 small vinyl stickers with a QR code linking to The Vine's Discord or website. Text on sticker: `the vine // thevineathens.church`. Place on laptops, water bottles, guitar cases (with permission of the owner). Vine members casually stick them places. Conversation starters.

**Print through:** DRC Printing or StickerMule.com

### 2. Free Coffee at Community Events
Show up at any public event (not just festivals) with a 5-gallon cold brew dispenser, cups, and a small sign: `free coffee from the vine`. Farmers Market, Soap Box Derby, library book sales, park days. Cost: ~$20 per event. Impact: enormous.

### 3. "Left Behind" Cards
Small, tasteful business cards left at coffee shops, restaurants, and tip jars with generous tips:

> Front: `the vine — where misfits find family`
> Back: `thevineathens.church // sundays 10:30am // athens, tn`

Leave one with every tip. Leave one in every library book you return. Leave one on every coffee shop community board.

### 4. Discord Bot Announcements
Set up a Discord bot that automatically posts event reminders 7 days and 1 day before each event. Reduce no-shows by 30%.

### 5. "Nerd Culture" Meme Account
Create an Instagram account (or series of posts) specifically for faith + nerd culture memes. Not churchy memes. Not "Christian cringe." Actual funny content that gamers, coders, and bikers would share. This is how you build organic reach with the target audience.

### 6. Chalk Art
Before major events, use sidewalk chalk on downtown Athens sidewalks (where permitted):
`game night this friday → thevineathens.church/respawn`
`free tech help this saturday → the library`
Chalk is temporary, free, and eye-catching.

### 7. Car/Truck Magnets
Custom magnets for Vine members' vehicles: small vine logo + `thevineathens.church`. Not a bumper sticker (those are permanent and polarizing). A magnet that can be applied and removed. $5–10 each from DRC Printing.

### 8. Sponsored Trophies/Prizes
For Respawn tournament nights, create custom 3D-printed or laser-cut trophies with The Vine branding. Winners take them home and show friends. Conversation starts. (TCAT Athens has maker programs that could help produce these.)

### 9. Community WiFi Name
If The Vine has a meeting space, name the guest WiFi: `TheVine-FreeWiFi-AllWelcome` or `WhereM1sf1tsF1ndFam1ly`. Everyone sees it when they connect.

### 10. Console/Gas Pump Card Holders
Those little card holders that stick to gas pumps, ATMs, and other public surfaces? Annoying when used for scams. *Useful* when they say: "Free game night — first Friday every month — thevineathens.church/respawn"

## 18. PROMOTION CALENDAR TEMPLATE

For each event, follow this timeline:

| Timing | Action |
|---|---|
| **4 weeks before** | Submit to ALL community calendars (Locable, Make It in McMinn, Discover McMinn, Eventbrite, Meetup). Design graphics. |
| **3 weeks before** | Post announcement on all Facebook groups. Post to Nextdoor. Print flyers. |
| **2 weeks before** | Distribute flyers to bulletin boards and business partners. Instagram announcement post. Discord announcement. |
| **1 week before** | Radio spot airs (if paid). Second Facebook group post. Instagram Story countdown. Discord reminder. Email newsletter inclusion. Nextdoor reminder. |
| **3 days before** | Instagram Reel or Story. Facebook event reminder. Text chain to Vine members: "Reminder — bring a friend!" |
| **Day of** | Instagram Stories throughout the event. Discord live updates. Facebook live-post. |
| **Day after** | Thank-you post on Facebook and Instagram with photos. Discord recap. Email thank-you to attendees (if emails collected). |
| **1 week after** | Follow up personally with every new face. Invite to Discord. Invite to next event. |

## 19. DESIGN STANDARDS & BRAND VOICE

Every piece of publicity must feel like it came from the same place. Consistency builds recognition.

### Visual Identity

| Element | Standard |
|---|---|
| **Primary colors** | Background: `#0a0a0f` (near black). Accent: `#5cb85c` (vine green). Secondary: `#d4a843` (warm amber). |
| **Typography** | Headers: Space Grotesk (Bold). Body: Space Grotesk (Regular). Accent/Labels: JetBrains Mono. Handwritten: Caveat. |
| **Logo** | SVG vine-in-leaf icon (from website). Used small, never dominant. |
| **Photography** | Real people. Real moments. Dark/moody lighting. Never stock photos. |
| **Tone** | Warm, direct, slightly irreverent, never cheesy. Like talking to a smart friend. |

### Voice Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| "Come hang out with us" | "We invite you to join us for worship" |
| "No dress code. No judgment." | "All are welcome at our family-friendly services" |
| "Bring your questions. All of them." | "Discover the answers you've been searching for" |
| "Free snacks. Trash talk encouraged." | "Refreshments will be provided" |
| "We're coders and bikers, gamers and grandparents" | "We are a diverse and inclusive congregation" |
| Use lowercase. Use contractions. Use humor. | Use formal language. Use church jargon. Use clip art. |

### What NOT to Put on Publicity

- ❌ Stock photos of smiling diverse families
- ❌ Crosses, doves, or stained glass imagery
- ❌ Bible verses as the main headline (fine in small print or inside)
- ❌ The word "fellowship" (too churchy — use "community" or "crew")
- ❌ "Join us this Sunday!" as the primary CTA (too generic)
- ❌ Pastel colors, script fonts, or anything that looks like a women's retreat brochure

### Moderate Budget (Established Presence)

| Item | Est. Cost | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Everything above | ~$1,000 | Year 1 |
| WYXI radio spots (package) | $150–$300/month | 3–4 months/year |
| Daily Post-Athenian ads | $150–$400/month | 2–3 months/year |
| Billboard (poster-size, 1 location) | $560–$900/month | 1–2 months |
| Instagram promoted posts | $50–$100/month | Ongoing |
| Professional event photography | $150/event | Quarterly |
| T-shirts for volunteer team (25) | $250 | Annual |
| **TOTAL (Year 1 estimate)** | **~$3,500–$5,500** | |

### Premium Budget (Full Presence)

All of the above, plus:
| Item | Est. Cost |
|---|---|
| Digital billboard (1 location, 2 months) | $3,400–$11,500 |
| Video production for YouTube/Instagram | $500–$2,000 |
| Professional branding package (extended) | $1,000–$3,000 |
| Direct mail postcards to Athens households | $1,500–$3,000 |
| **TOTAL (Year 1 estimate)** | **$10,000–$20,000** |

**Recommendation:** Start with the minimal budget. Let the reputation build. Invest in paid advertising only after the organic reputation is established (6–12 months). Money spent on billboards before you have a thriving community is money wasted. Money spent on cold brew and invite cards pays for itself.
